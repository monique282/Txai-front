### Commands to Run the Project


To use a mock API and to access the data that will feed the project and run it, do the following:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your machine: [https://github.com/monique282/Txai-front](https://github.com/monique282/Imovel-Guide);
2. In another terminal, run the `npm install` command to install all libraries.
5. Use the .env.example file to create the .env .
6. Run the `npm run start` command to run the project. This command provides a link that you can open in your browser to interact with the project.

```
Remembering, all the commands above must be given in the folder that corresponds to the project.
For the complete project to work you need Back-end too, which is in the repository https://github.com/monique282/Txai-Back

```
